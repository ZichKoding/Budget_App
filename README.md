# Budget_App
I upload progress to https://repl.it/@ZichKoding/Budget-App almost daily. Python 3.8.2

This is the third out of five projects for becoming certified in Scientific Computing with Python. A week of waking up early and studying/writing Python code, and I have finished a crude version of the budget app. To see what it does I have added main.py, which is straight from the template that freecodecamp.org provides, and below I have copied what the out come will be if you run main.py. I still need to clean up the code in budget.py and add better commentary through the code, but it still works properly.
