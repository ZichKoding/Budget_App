# Budget_App
Python 3.8.2
I upload progress to https://repl.it/@ZichKoding/Budget-App almost daily, and you can run this code as well on replit very easily.

This is the third out of five projects for becoming certified in Scientific Computing with Python. A week of waking up early and studying/writing Python code, and I have finished a crude version of the budget app. To see what it does I have added main.py, which is straight from the template that freecodecamp.org provided me for testing my code. I still need to clean up the code in budget.py and add better commentary through the code, but it still works properly.
