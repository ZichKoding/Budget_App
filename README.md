# Budget_App
This is the third out of five projects for becoming certified in Scientific Computing with Python. It's took me 6 days just to get the Category class completed. Now I have to work on the function to create a spend chart. 
This app is not finished yet. I upload progress to https://repl.it/@ZichKoding/Budget-App.
